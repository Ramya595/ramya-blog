# 🔎 Binary Search — Efficient Searching in Sorted Arrays

Binary Search is one of the most fundamental algorithms in computer science.  
It helps you **search an element in a sorted array in O(log n)** time — making it extremely efficient for large datasets.

This article covers:

- Brute Force Approach  
- Why Binary Search is Better  
- Step-by-step Explanation  
- JavaScript & Python Code  
- Real-World Use Cases  
- Time & Space Complexity

## 🪜 1. Problem Definition

> **Given a sorted array and a target value, determine if the value exists in the array and return its index (or -1 if not found).**

Example:

```js
Input: arr = [2, 4, 7, 9, 13, 21], target = 9
Output: 3
````

## 🐢 2. Brute Force Approach (Linear Search)

The simplest way is to scan every element from left to right.

### **Idea**

Check each element one by one until you find the target.

### **JavaScript Implementation**

```js
function linearSearch(arr, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === target) return i;
  }
  return -1;
}
```

### **Complexity**

* ⏱ **Time:** O(n)
* 💾 **Space:** O(1)

<Callout type="warning">
Perfect for *unsorted* arrays, but slow when data is huge.
</Callout>

## ⚡ 3. Better Approach — Binary Search

Binary Search uses the **divide and conquer** technique.
Instead of checking every element, it eliminates half the array in each step.

### **Working Principle**

1. Find the **middle** element
2. If it's equal to the target → return index
3. If target < mid → search the **left half**
4. If target > mid → search the **right half**
5. Repeat until left > right

---

## 🧠 4. Binary Search Code

### **JavaScript Implementation**

```js
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
    if (target < arr[mid]) right = mid - 1;
    else left = mid + 1;
  }

  return -1;
}
```

### **Python Implementation**

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif target < arr[mid]:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return -1
```

## 🔍 5. Example Walkthrough

Let’s search `9` in:

```
[2, 4, 7, 9, 13, 21]
```

Steps:

1. Middle = 7 → target is greater → go right
2. New middle = 9 → match found

<Callout type="success">
Binary search finds it in **2 steps** instead of a full scan.
</Callout>

## 🌍 6. Real-World Use Cases

### **🛒 1. E-commerce Search**

Large sorted product catalogs use binary search to quickly locate items.

### **📚 2. Dictionaries & Spell Check**

Words are stored in sorted order → binary search for fast lookup.

### **📈 3. Stock Market Data**

Searching timestamps in sorted historical data.

### **🖥️ 4. Operating Systems**

Process scheduling tables & memory page tables use binary search.

### **🎮 5. Video Games**

Collision frames or sorted event lists for fast calculations.

## 📊 7. Time & Space Complexity

| Approach      | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Linear Search | O(n)            | O(1)             |
| Binary Search | O(log n)        | O(1)             |

<Callout type="info">
Binary Search is **exponentially faster** than brute force for large datasets.
</Callout>

## 🏁 8. Final Summary

* Use **linear search** when the array is *unsorted*
* Use **binary search** when the array is *sorted*
* Binary search is incredibly fast and used across many real-world systems
